{"name":"FancyWriter","tagline":"A simple IO wrapper for easy output of formatted plain text.","body":"# What is FancyWriter?\r\n\r\nFancyWriter is a wrapper around an IO object that allows you to augment text blocks with whitespace indentation and comment symbols, and to format simple CSV data series. It uses a simple DSL for defining indentations, comment sections, and rules for symbol-separated value lists out of Enumerables.\r\n\r\nThis gem originated from the need to create files in a simple plain-text format in which indentation is important: The TextGrid file format of Praat, a software used for linguistic and phonetic analyses (see http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/).\r\n\r\nFancyWriter can be found [at Github](https://github.com/pmenke/fancy_writer)!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
